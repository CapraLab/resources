Check out the sample data files we'll be using in the tutorial:
    - random set of sample lines from the GWAS catalog (n = 200)
    - BED file generated from the 18-state ChromHMM model run by Roadmap Epigenomics
    - GTF file from Ensembl for GRCh37.75

The GWAS Catalog file I made has an unknown spacing/delimiter problem… whoops.
Can you find and fix it without going through all 200 lines by hand?

What if I’m interested in a SNP with rsID = rs139770682.
What phenotype is that associated with?

Maybe we want to limit our results by ancestry.
Try pulling out only associations found in individuals of European or African descent.

I want to compare some enhancer identification methods in brain.
The enhancer states from ChromHMM we're interested in are denoted by EnhA1, EnhA2, and EnhWk.
How could we filter for just those regions?

Try to create a BED6 file with the following columns:
    [ chr ] [ start ] [ end ] [ name/state ] [ score ] [ strand ].

Since we don’t have a score or strand, put in the traditional placeholder value ('.').

Note that the possible ChromHMM states are:
    TssA, TssFlnk, TssFlnkU, TssFlnkD, Tx, TxWk, EnhG1, EnhG2, EnhA1, EnhA2,
    EnhWk, ZNF/Rpts, Het, TssBiv, EnhBiv, ReprPC, ReprPCWk, Quies

Finally, let's look at the GTF file.

I'll tell you that the important columns are:
    1 (chromosome),
    4 (start; 1-based),
    5 (end),
    7 (strand),
    10 (ensemble ID), and
    16 (gene biotype)

Create a BED6 file of gene features (where column 3 == 'gene') in the following order:
    [ chr ] [ start ] [ end ] [ ensembl ID ] [ gene biotype ] [ strand ].

Oh— and let’s add a 'chr' prefix to the chromosome number and remove chromosomes other than 1-22, X, or Y.
