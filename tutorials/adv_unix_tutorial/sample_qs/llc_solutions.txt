1. The GWAS Catalog file I made has an unknown spacing/delimiter problem… whoops.
      Can you find and fix it without going through all 200 lines by hand?
    cat -vet $FILE
    awk -v OFS="\t" '$1=$1' $FILE #replaces ALL whitespace with tabs. bad for this file.
    awk '{printf "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10 }' #long way of doing it
    sed 's/ \+/\t/' #will also do this; add g to replace all occurrences on a line rather than first

2. What if I’m interested in a SNP with rsID = rs139770682.
              What phenotype is that associated with?
        less gwasCatalog_2018-04-01_hg38_n-200.bed |grep rs139770682

3. Maybe we want to limit our results by ancestry. Try pulling out only
          associations found in individuals of European or African descent.
      less gwasCatalog_2018-04-01_hg38_n-200.bed |grep European > gwas_euro.bed
	grep '[^NR,]\sEuropean(;European)*?\s' #grabs just European and European;European lines

4. I want to compare some enhancer identification methods in brain. If the enhancer
      states from ChromHMM we're interested in are denoted by EnhA1, EnhA2, and EnhWk,
      how could we filter for just those regions? Try to create a BED6 file with the
      following columns: [ chr ] [ start ] [ end ] [ name/state ] [ score ] [ strand ].
      Since we don’t have a score or strand, put in the traditional placeholder value
      (‘.’). Note that the possible ChromHMM states are: TssA, TssFlnk, TssFlnkU,
      TssFlnkD, Tx, TxWk, EnhG1, EnhG2, EnhA1, EnhA2, EnhWk, ZNF/Rpts, Het, TssBiv,
      EnhBiv, ReprPC, ReprPCWk, Quies.
   grep 'EnhA1\|EnhA2\|EnhWk' E073_18_core_K27ac_mnemonics.bed | awk '{printf "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t.\t.\n",$1,$2,$3,$4}' > E073_18_core_K27ac_mnemonics.bed6

5. Finally, let’s look at the GTF file. If I tell you that the important columns
    are 1 (chromosome), 4 (start; 1-based), 5 (end), 7 (strand), 10 (ensemble ID),
    and 16 (gene biotype),  create a BED6 file of gene features (where column 3 == ‘gene’)
    in the following order: [ chr ] [ start ] [ end ] [ ensembl ID ] [ gene biotype ]
    [ strand ]. Oh— and let’s add a ‘chr’ prefix to the chromosome number and
    remove chromosomes other than 1-22, X, or Y.
  less Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf.gz | grep -v 'HSCHR\|HG\|GL\|MT' | awk '/^#/{print} !/^#/{printf "chr%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n",$1,$4-1,$5,$10,$16,$7}' > Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75_filtered.gtf
